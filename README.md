## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express
- **Socket.IO** for real-time communication
- **File-based storage** for game results
- **State management** with Map-based room tracking
- **Error handling** with comprehensive try-catch blocks

### Frontend
- **React** with hooks
- **Socket.IO client** for real-time updates
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox** for responsive design
- **Modern UI/UX** with smooth animations

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the server directory:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
```

## Game Flow

### Room Creation
1. Host creates a room and gets a 6-character room code
2. Share the code with friends to join
3. Wait for players to join (minimum 1 player)

### Gameplay
1. **Host starts the game** - Cards are shuffled and first card is shown
2. **Voting phase** - Players vote "Human" or "AI" for the scenario
3. **Discussion phase** - Host reveals all choices for group discussion
4. **Next card** - Host advances to the next scenario
5. **Repeat** - Continue until all cards are completed

### Late-Joining Process
1. **Join mid-game** - Use room code to join active games
2. **Missed cards notification** - System alerts you about missed content
3. **Review previous cards** - View missed scenarios and group responses
4. **Participate fully** - Join current and future card discussions

## System Architecture

### State Management
```
RoomManager Class
â”œâ”€â”€ rooms (Map) - Active room storage
â”œâ”€â”€ socketToRoom (Map) - Socket to room mapping
â”œâ”€â”€ createRoom() - Create new game room
â”œâ”€â”€ addPlayer() - Add player with late-joining support
â”œâ”€â”€ removePlayer() - Remove player with host transfer
â”œâ”€â”€ startGame() - Initialize game with shuffled cards
â”œâ”€â”€ submitChoice() - Record player choices
â”œâ”€â”€ nextCard() - Advance to next card
â”œâ”€â”€ cleanupInactiveRooms() - Automatic cleanup
â””â”€â”€ getMissedCards() - Get missed cards for late joiners
```

### Game States
- **lobby** - Waiting for host to start
- **voting** - Players voting on current card
- **discussing** - Revealed choices, group discussion
- **finished** - Game completed

### Error Handling
- **Input validation** - Username and room ID validation
- **Authorization checks** - Host-only actions protected
- **Connection recovery** - Automatic reconnection attempts
- **Graceful degradation** - Fallback mechanisms for failures

## Admin Dashboard

Access the admin dashboard at `/admin`:

- **Real-time stats** - Active rooms, current players, connections
- **Room monitoring** - Live view of all active games
- **Game state tracking** - Current state of each room
- **Player management** - Track player movements and actions

## Research Applications

This game is designed for research on:
- **Human-AI interaction** - How people perceive AI vs human behavior
- **Group dynamics** - How discussions influence individual choices
- **Technology acceptance** - Attitudes toward AI in social contexts
- **Decision-making** - Factors that influence human vs AI categorization

### Data Collection
- **Game sessions** - Duration, completion rates, player counts
- **Player participation** - Join/leave times, host transfers
- **Card responses** - Individual votes, response times
- **Room activity** - All game events and state changes

### Data Privacy
- No personal information is collected beyond IP addresses
- All data is anonymized for research purposes
- No login required - completely anonymous participation
- Data retention policies can be customized
