## Analytics & Research Features

### Data Collection
The game automatically collects comprehensive data for research purposes:

- **User visits** - IP addresses, user agents, session tracking
- **Game sessions** - Duration, completion rates, player counts
- **Player participation** - Join/leave times, host transfers
- **Card responses** - Individual votes, response times
- **Room activity** - All game events and state changes

### Admin Dashboard
Access the analytics dashboard at `/admin`:

- **Real-time stats** - Active rooms, current players
- **Visitor trends** - Daily unique visitors and total visits
- **Game analytics** - Completion rates, average duration, player engagement
- **Response distribution** - Human vs AI voting patterns
- **Card performance** - Most discussed scenarios and response rates

### API Endpoints
All analytics data is available via REST API:

- `GET /analytics/visits` - Visitor statistics
- `GET /analytics/games` - Game session data
- `GET /analytics/players` - Player participation metrics
- `GET /analytics/responses` - Response distribution
- `GET /analytics/cards` - Individual card performance

### Data Export
Game results are automatically saved to:
- **Redis** - Temporary storage (24-hour TTL)
- **SQLite** - Persistent analytics database
- **JSON files** - Individual game results

## Game Flow

### Room Creation
1. Host creates a room and gets a 6-character room code
2. Share the code with friends to join
3. Wait for players to join (minimum 1 player)

### Gameplay
1. **Host starts the game** - Cards are shuffled and first card is shown
2. **Voting phase** - Players vote "Human" or "AI" for the scenario
3. **Discussion phase** - Host reveals all choices for group discussion
4. **Next card** - Host advances to the next scenario
5. **Repeat** - Continue until all cards are completed

### Late-Joining Process
1. **Join mid-game** - Use room code to join active games
2. **Missed cards notification** - System alerts you about missed content
3. **Review previous cards** - View missed scenarios and group responses
4. **Participate fully** - Join current and future card discussions

## Research Applications

This game is designed for research on:
- **Human-AI interaction** - How people perceive AI vs human behavior
- **Group dynamics** - How discussions influence individual choices
- **Technology acceptance** - Attitudes toward AI in social contexts
- **Decision-making** - Factors that influence human vs AI categorization

### Data Privacy
- No personal information is collected beyond IP addresses
- All data is anonymized for research purposes
- No login required - completely anonymous participation
- Data retention policies can be customized
